Future Agent,

When authoring new scripts for this CLI, follow these rules:

1. Location: place every script under `scripts/` so the parser can discover it via `<name>.py`.
2. Entry point: scripts must be executable (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and run their logic inside a `main()` or equivalent guard.
3. Input contract:
   - Read a single JSON document from stdin.
   - Expect exactly two keys: `input_files` (list of paths) and `extra_args` (list of arguments, often flags like `-mode fast`).
4. Output contract:
   - Emit exactly one JSON object to stdout.
   - Required keys: `output_files` (list of resulting paths), `is_success` (bool), `error_message` (null or string).
   - Never print additional text to stdout; use stderr for debugging.
5. Failure handling: set `is_success` to false and populate `error_message` when anything goes wrong; still provide the best `output_files` you can (even an empty list).
6. File discipline: scripts should write outputs under the working directory or an explicit path passed through `extra_args`. Respect upstream `input_files` unless the script intentionally ignores them.
7. Composeability: remember that outputs may feed downstream functors or parallel branches, so keep filenames unique and deterministic when possible.

Thanks for keeping the pipeline predictable.
